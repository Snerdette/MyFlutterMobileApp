A Flutter Mobile app that searches a string and returns ebay results for that string.


##
I started with a video tutorial on flutter mobile app:
"Flutter Tutorial for Beginners - Build iOS and Android Apps with Google's Flutter & Dart"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLSG_Wh_YWc

Then proceeded to follow a tutorial on a text input box and one on API calls:

## Status / Mistakes
 - On the images branch it lists a card with an image, the moreCards branch you can
have multiple cards.

- I didn't get it all working together, I had some set backs with the installation,
but i just ran put of time.

- Also forgot the OAuth I needed to apply for until I got to the API calls last night
